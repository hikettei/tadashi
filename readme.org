* Tadashi

** Documentation:

Documentation will be made available on
https://tadashi.readthedocs.io/ (after the double blind review).

[Docs are in progress]


** Build instructions:

Before building, install LLVM and other (system) packages (check
[[docker/tadashi.dockerfile][dockerfile]] for an exact list of ~apt-get~ packages).

#+begin_src bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vatai/tadashi.git
mkdir tadashi/build
cd tadashi/build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
#+end_src

** Run from docker

#+begin_src bash
mk_dot_env.sh  # create .env file with USER, UID, GROUP, GID
docker compose build # build images
docker compose run --rm -it tadashi
#+end_src

The tadashi binds the host repo to ~/workdir~ inside the container.

Tadashi should be rebuilt from the container (i.e. these are
instructions primarily for developers):
#+begin_src bash
mkdir /workdir/build
cd /workdir/build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
#+end_src
The dependencies are built during the ~docker compose build~ command
under ~/tadashi/build/_deps~ and the environment is set up that these
dependencies are used (i.e. not rebuilt again).
