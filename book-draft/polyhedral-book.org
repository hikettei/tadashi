#+title: A gentle introduction to the polyhedral model

* Introduction

The polyhedral model, also known as polyhedral compilation, polytope
model, is fundamentally a device to efficiently express properties and
transformation of fairly regular loops of scientific number crunching
calculations (e.g., weather simulations),...


which often (give a more precise definition of such loop in Section
[[sec:SCoP]])
