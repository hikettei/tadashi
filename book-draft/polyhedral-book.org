#+title: A gentle introduction to the polyhedral model

* Introduction

The polyhedral model, also known as polyhedral compilation, polytope
model, is fundamentally a device or tool to efficiently express and
reason about fairly regular loops, usually occurring in scientific
number crunching programs (e.g., weather simulations), with the aim to
apply high level optimisations.  Such optimisations are expressed as
transformations, and the polyhedral model guarantees the legality of
the transformations.
